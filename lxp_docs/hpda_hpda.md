## Introduction

Welcome to the High Performance Data Analytics documentation.

This section has been created to show best practices for parallelizing, scaling and optimising your Data Science applications and developping end-to-end AI workloads on MeluXina.

## Data Science Development Tools

### JupyterLab

Jupyter Lab is one of the most widely used IDEs in the data science community. It is the choice tool for many data scientists when it comes to quick prototyping and exploratory analysis. JupyterLab neatly bundles many functionalities together, enabling collaborative, extensible, and scalable data science.

The following pages will show you how to use JupyterLab on MeluXina, depending on your client environment:
