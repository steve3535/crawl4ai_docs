## System overview

This section provides an overview of the MeluXina infrastructure, including system architecture, components and networks.

## Gaining access

Learn about possibilities for obtaining access to MeluXina, the access process, and managing your resource allocations.

## First steps

If you are new to using an HPC system or to MeluXina, this section covers the essentials: connecting to the platform, data transfers and running applications.

More in depth topics can be found in the dedicated HPC and our HPDA sections.

## HPC

HPC power users will find here additional information about MeluXina and its environment enabling an efficient and effective utilization of the platform.

## HPDA

High Performance Data Analytics sits at the cross-roads between Data Analytics and High Performance Computing. This section will help data scientists and data engineers to take advantage of MeluXina for data-driven workloads.

## FPGA

Designed for compute acceleration, Meluxina's FPGA nodes have two  520N-MX PCIe board featuring Intel’s Stratix 10 MX2100 FPGA with integrated HBM2 memory. The size and speed of HBM2 (16GB at up to 512GB/s) enables acceleration of memory-bound applications. These cards can be programmed using the Intel® FPGA SDK for OpenCL and/or the Intel® oneAPI software development toolkit.
